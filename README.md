## Description
<a href="https://emsaw721.github.io/take-a-jacket/"> Weather Dashboard </a> is an application that allows the user to look up the weather in any city using third party api's. 

## Usage
Weather Dashboard consists of a search box where the user can look up any city in the world and find weather data displayed. 

At first, the application user will see the opening page.

The user will see current city data as well as a five-day-forecast displayed. The user will also see the city they just searched in a gray box below, indicating it is an already searched item.
